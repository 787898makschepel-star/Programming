/**
 * Ideally just exportName and exportURI should be made publicly available but
 * we also make exportPath available because the export tool, also returns the
 * exportPath in its response when the MCP server is running connected to stdio
 * transport. The reasoning behind this is that a few clients, Cursor in
 * particular, as of the date of this writing (7 August 2025) cannot refer to
 * resource URIs which means they have no means to access the exported resource.
 * As of this writing, majority of the usage of our MCP server is behind STDIO
 * transport so we can assume that for most of the usages, if not all, the MCP
 * server will be running on the same machine as of the MCP client and thus we
 * can provide the local path to export so that these clients which do not still
 * support parsing resource URIs, can still work with the exported data. We
 * expect for clients to catch up and implement referencing resource URIs at
 * which point it would be safe to remove the `exportPath` from the publicly
 * exposed properties of an export.
 *
 * The editors that we would like to watch out for are Cursor and Windsurf as
 * they don't yet support working with Resource URIs.
 *
 * Ref Cursor: https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-mcp-resource-feature-support/50987
 * JIRA: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MCP-104 */
